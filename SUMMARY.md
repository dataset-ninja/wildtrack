**Wildtrack: Multi-Camera Person Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the surveillance industry. 

The dataset consists of 2807 images with 42721 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*pedestrian*).

Images in the Wildtrack dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 7 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 7 cameras: ***camera 1*** (401 images), ***camera 2*** (401 images), ***camera 3*** (401 images), ***camera 4*** (401 images), ***camera 5*** (401 images), ***camera 6*** (401 images), and ***camera 7*** (401 images). Additionally, every label contains information about ***person id***, and ***position id***. Explore it in supervisely labeling tool. The dataset was released in 2017 by the Machine Learning group, Idiap Research Institute & Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, CVLab, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, and Computer Vision Lab, ETH Zurich.
